# ♟️ Real-Time Chess Game

A simple real-time multiplayer chess game built using **WebSockets**. This project allows two players to connect and play chess against each other live over the network. It uses a chess engine library for move validation and game state management.

> ⚠️ Note: This project currently focuses on backend functionality and WebSocket-based real-time communication. The UI is minimal and limited to a basic chessboard for testing and playing purposes.
